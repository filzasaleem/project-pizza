# project-pizza (week 1)

First week's challenge in Technigo React/Redux Upskill course. (to build a pizzeria app)

 ## The problem
I pretty much wrote the code from top to bottom, step by step. I used the the objects for storing all the options although objects were not introduced in the course yet but i wanted to approach the solution with this technique.
Switch operator are also used.
as this was the first project so I was happy with what i  acheived.
I completed all the stretch goals.
